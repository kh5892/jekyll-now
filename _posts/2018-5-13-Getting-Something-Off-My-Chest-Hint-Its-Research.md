title: How do you publish a paper as an outsider? 
categories: Personal
---

This thought has been waying me down an awful lot lately. It is completely opaque to me, even after 2 years of graduate education, how in the world people go about publishing papers. I can't count the number of frustrating instances in which I ask a person what they are doing and all they mysteriously respond with is "research". That's great. I'm glad you are doing your job at your job. But honestly what are you doing day to day?? What is the process to follow???! It seems like typically there are two ways to go about doing this: 

1. Find a mentor/collaborator and learn through the immersive experience of being within a research environment
2. Be brilliant

Unfortunately route (1) hasn't exactly worked out for me. I won't go into the details, even though I most probably should because there are a lot of lessons to be learned from those experiences, but that is not the point of today's post. Hopefully, this post will include actionable points for me to get actual research ideas out. Most of these are culled or almost directly quoted from other people. I will do my best to paraphrase and rephrase as I believe immensely in the value of internalization through writing. 

I am focusing on route (2) and I am trying to break down the barrier that one must be "brilliant" in order to get this done. 

> Academic journals are not a good starting point for pushing your findings, unless you are already very familiar with the field (publications, style of writing, etc). It does not suffice to have a new idea. And very easily you can get discouraged, for no good reason.

The theme is to write a lot and to open source. Everything that I produce should be at a quality where I am not embarassed to be sharing with the public. This unfortunately takes a lot of time and energy. 

Here's a really good quote that I put high faith in: 

>Steps to publishing your research:
>1. Do a literature survey and read LOTS of papers. If you are not coming from the standard academic route you are probably vastly underestimating how much existing work has been published. To publish your research you need to place it in the right context, with citations, and really understand what is novel about your ideas. Read lots of papers, take notes, keep track of the bibliographic details. Follow up on citations to find more papers.

>2.Write up your understanding of the relevant field as a survey of existing literature with citations. This will clarify your thinking and help you become familiar with standard terminology. This will also be part of your finished paper.

>3.Write up your idea using terminology and notation consistent with your existing survey. Discuss what is novel and different about your idea.

>4.Analyze your idea from the point of view of other paradigms. Answer possible critiques that would come from other ways of thinking about the same problem. If you've discovered "standard" ways of evaluating your type of idea, do the evaluation to see how you compare.

>5.Get feedback. Get opinions from as many other people as you can that are as good as you can find. In the draft paper, thank everyone that gives you any feedback. If people give you substantial ideas that improve the work, ask if they want to be co-authors and work with you a bit more.

>6. Once you feel there is a real research contribution in your paper draft, and people you have shown it to think it is good, start working on getting it published. Put it up on preprint sites and send it to conferences or journals that are relevant. By this point you should know the right venues based on your survey work.

So it seems like this is what I am missing. I do my literature reviews rather blithely. I should definitely start blogging more; rephrasing and using their terminology.

"Actionable" Steps: 
1. Read more 
2. Write even more
3. Start from a blog post (with working code!) and then share it

I'm not sure if I have really accomplished very much just now in this post, but it feels good to get some organized thoughts down. Planning and following through are certainly not my strengths and that is something I am desperately trying to work on as well.
