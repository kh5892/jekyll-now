# Problem: How do I become and Active Creator? 

I am trying to get more into the habit of being an active creator rather than just a passive consumer of knowledge. It's been hard. I don't understand it at all. 

I don't quite understand how to start a project. Learning a new skill seems fundamentally passive to me and I can't quite figure out how to make it active. I could go onto Kaggle and find a data set and walk through someone's tutorial. Or I could prop open a textbook and start implementing on my own. 

> But I am awful at implementation. None of the algorithms that I implement, which are pretty much supposedly guaranteed to be true have worked out very well for me at all. 

The most that I can do to become an active creator is to take someone else's papers or textbook examples and try to rephrase it in my own words. However, at times this doesn't seem to be sufficient. Especially when I can't get code to work. It's frustrating to reach a barrier and not know how to take a smaller step. 

# Project Ideas: 

Recommendation Engines: 
1. I am interested in working with Yelp Data Set. The use case is this: Mary lives in Seattle and she has a repertoire of favorite restaurants that she likes and reasons why she likes them, which she details quite religiously in her Yelp Reviews. However, next week she is going on a road trip to Tuscon, Arizona. How do we make recommendations for her once her geolocation changes drastically and there is not as much data related to her regarding this new location? 
2. I am interested in again working with the Yelp Data Set. It has occurred to me that if someone is going to go through the effort to write a truly useful review, if someone is truly passionate about talking about their restaurant experiences, wouldn't they rather do it on their own personal blog? I feel like some of the most informative pieces of information in the problem of restaurant ranking is hard to source. Yelp data is easy, because it's in a central location and you get to use wisdom of the masses, but is it truly efficient? What if a restaurant has many reviews based solely on the fact that it is a popular tourist destination (i.e. that McDonalds in front of Pine Street where people peddle drugs)

Data Science: 
1. I would love to do some NLP sentient analysis with the data available. 
2. I would really like to demonstrate my knowledge of statistical testing on a huge data set like that
3. I'd like to demonstrate
