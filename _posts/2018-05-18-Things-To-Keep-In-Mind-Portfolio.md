# Data Science Funemployment and the Works

Actually though some helpful advice I have come across. The hardest part about starting a datascience portfolio is probably knowing what kind of projects to do: 


* Extracting insights from raw data, and presenting those insights to others.

** An example would be analyzing ad click rates, and discovering that it's much more cost effective to advertise to people who are 18 to 21 then to people who are 21 to 25 -- this adds business value by allowing the business to optimize its ad spend.


* Building systems that offer direct value to the customer.

** An example would be a data scientist at Facebook optimizing the news feed to show better results to users -- this generates direct revenue for Facebook because more news feed engagement means more ad engagement.
