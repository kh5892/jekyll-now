I need to start writing out reviews of things that I read so that I may reflect on them and decide what I want to do next. Even if they are just 

## A short & practical HOW-TO guide to scrape data from a website using Python
The question is for me to figure out what data to scrape. Nevertheless this will probably be very VERY useful. Actually fuck that, it's a useful example and it's not very hard to scrape a web-page--probably exceedingly fun actually, but I have no idea of what kind of pages I want to scrape so whatever to that. 

## Do you have time for a quick chat?
Start with a guideline of clear discussion points and attach to email. Propose a time and get there early. Don't waste anyone's time. This is quite a good article, although rather common sense as well. Talking with humans is way too hard. Why can't we all just be cats.

## How to Compile a Data Science Portfolio
Scrape your own damn data! Data cleaning is the most important part of the process in industry. Apparently easy to scrape APIs include Wikipedia and twitter. Twitter data doesn't seem to be entirely too interesting for some reason...(figure it out at a later date), whereas wikipedia could be more interesting. A suggested hypothesis is to figure out divorce rates of famous Hollywood actors/actresses. Afterwards, it would be nice to productionize into a Twitterbot?? Whatever the hell that means. Regardless, the first step is clear and relatively straightforward: write a wikipedia scraper! I'd love to work with an allRecipes scraper as well. This first step should actually be fun. 

The next step of actually doing the NLP seems very difficult and challenging. Let me first try to walk through this nice Kaggle tutorial for a wordpress data set and see if I can make a t-SNE plot out of it or something. Seems like takes a lot of data and is finnicky at best in Python. 

But the most important skills to emphasize in the job search is: data cleaning, data visualization with very few words apparently, and productionizing (package + deploy). 

Anyway, here are sources that I found to be illuminating:

He's got a nice website and github as well. And he got exactly the kind of job that I would have wanted anyways. 

## Which Tech Companies Will Offer the Most Career Growth
Jason Goodman talks about this. The co-creator of Wealthfront puts together a nice list. Hopefully I will find a job before wealthfront goes defunct. 

## People Whose Learning Styles I Particularly Admire


Random Assortment of Goals in No Particular Order:
1. How to write production level code
2. Goal: play with topic models (and get it to work. Ha!), implement LDA, implement coordinate descent, implement ALS
3. Goal: I also have to practice for data scientist interviews that I don't seem to be getting
