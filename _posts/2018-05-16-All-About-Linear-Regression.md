title: Regression Part One--The Linear Kind!!
categories: Interviews
---

Part One: 
* Derive linear regression (hat matrix, beta, predictors)
* When is the linear model the best? What are conditions when it fails? 
* Gauss-Markov (BLUE) proof. 

Part Two (to be fleshed out in part two of course): 
* Ridge regression 
* Lasso
* Regularization
* Logistic Regression of course (feeds nicely into classification)

Side note: can I do an article review of the black box variational inference algorithm?
