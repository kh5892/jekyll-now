* [ ] A function that plots all the variables against the label (this will already give you some insights to talk about!). 
* [ ] A function that bins continuous variables into classes. 
* [ ] A function to extract info from dates. 
* [ ] A function building the ROC curve and optimizing the cutoff point. 
* [ ] A function to cross-validate. 
* [ ] A function that returns partial dependence plots for the top random forest variables. 
* [ ] A function that builds a decision tree and automatically extracts the top 3/4 splits.

This is all extremely straightforward and routine analysis that I used to perform back when I was a data scientist. Would be cool to actually have these tools available as scripts. Let me first try to write them as convenient python functions though
